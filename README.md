# Ray Wenderlich Firebase Tutorial : Real Time Chat
I've been following the Firebase tutorial for making a real-time chat from [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5359-firebase-tutorial-real-time-chat). Very clear explanation, you should try it yourself. And I've change a few line of codes, it's more like updating to support newest Swift version. I hope you finish the tutorial like I do. Thinks it's like a short clue if you got error from the tutorial.
